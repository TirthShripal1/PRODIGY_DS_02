# PRODIGY_DS_02
# Introduction:
Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Exploration repository! In this project, we conduct data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. This dataset provides a fascinating glimpse into the demographics and fate of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which tragically sank on its maiden voyage in 1912.

Feel free to browse my projects and reach out for collaborations or discussions. Let's uncover insights together!
# Aim:
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
# Dataset Overview:
The Titanic dataset includes information on passengers such as their age, sex, passenger class, fare paid, cabin location (where available), and survival status. It is widely used in data science education for understanding basic concepts in data analysis and predictive modeling.
# Objectives:
1) Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values, handle outliers, and ensuring data consistency to prepare the dataset for analysis.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the distribution of passengers across different demographics and ticket classes and also analyzing factors that potentially influenced survival rates, such as age, sex, and passenger class.
# Conclusion:
By the end of this analysis, we hope to uncover interesting patterns and insights from the Titanic dataset, shedding light on the factors that influenced survival rates among passengers. This repository serves as a practical resource for learning fundamental data analysis techniques and exploring real-world datasets.
